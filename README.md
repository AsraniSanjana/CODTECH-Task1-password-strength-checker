# CODTECH-Task1-password-strength-checker

‚úÖ Instructions to run this code:

üí† guess-pswd_only-alpha.py 
generates the txt files of all possible combinations of alphabets for the inputted length. eg.: length3-AlphaCombinations.txt
(UNREPEATED)

similarly, 
üí† guess-pswd_only-numeric.py 
generates the txt files of all possible combinations of numbers for the inputted length. eg.: length3-NumericCombinations.txt

the words in these txt files are checked to be the part of the password.

üîµ The pswd strength is calculated on the basis of:

1üîπ personal details provided like dob, name, pet's name

i.e. for eg. 
if name or reversed name or substring of them is in pswd: score-4
dob is part of pswd: score-4
if pet name is in pswd: score-2

2üîπ pswd is found in all potential combinations generated files: score-2

3üîπ pswd is in dictionary: score-2

4üîπ length is too small (less than 5): score=5
